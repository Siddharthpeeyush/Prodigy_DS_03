# Prodigy_DS_03

Task Overview:
The primary objective of this task was to construct a decision tree classifier capable of predicting whether a customer would purchase a product or service, leveraging demographic and behavioral data. To achieve this, I utilized a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains pertinent information for training the classifier.

Knowledge Gained:
Task 3 facilitated a comprehensive understanding of building decision tree classifiers for predictive modeling endeavors. Through hands-on experience with the Bank Marketing dataset, I honed my proficiency in leveraging demographic and behavioral data to discern patterns influencing customer purchasing decisions. This task augmented my skill set in predictive modeling techniques and enhanced my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
